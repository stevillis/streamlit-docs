# Widgets
When you've got the data or model into the state that you want to explore, you can add in widgets like st.slider(), st.button() or st.selectbox(). 
It's really straightforward â€” treat widgets as variables:
"""

import streamlit as st
x = st.slider('x')  # ğŸ‘ˆ this is a widget
st.write(x, 'squared is', x * x)
