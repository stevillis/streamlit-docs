# Streamlit

## Main concepts

Working with Streamlit is simple. First you sprinkle a few Streamlit commands into a normal Python script, then you run it with streamlit run:

```shell
streamlit run your_script.py [-- script args]
```

## Running

```shell
python -m streamlit run your_script.py
```

is equivalent to:

```shell
streamlit run your_script.py
```
