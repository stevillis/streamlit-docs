# Layout
Streamlit makes it easy to organize your widgets in a left panel sidebar with st.sidebar. 
Each element that's passed to st.sidebar is pinned to the left, allowing users to focus on the content in your app while still having access to UI controls.

For example, if you want to add a selectbox and a slider to a sidebar, use st.sidebar.slider and st.sidebar.selectbox instead of st.slider and st.selectbox:
"""

import streamlit as st

# Add a selectbox to the sidebar:
add_selectbox = st.sidebar.selectbox(
    'How would you like to be contacted?',
    ('Email', 'Home phone', 'Mobile phone')
)

# Add a slider to the sidebar:
add_slider = st.sidebar.slider(
    'Select a range of values',
    0.0, 100.0, (0.0, 10.0)
)
